## Lessons Learned
In this project we learned some of the bugs that may be typically associated with DAO design in web applications. Examples included SQL statement errors, Request mapping paths, and jsp form type. We relied on error messages as well as console messages to trace the source of our bugs. In the future it could prove more efficient to use the de-bugging features included in most ide's. Spring MVC Testing, at a glance, also looks like a potentially powerful tool in searching for bugs. For this project the following would have been helpful testing methods: MOCK MVC, Integration, and MockHTTPServlet. 
We used SQL <em>queries</em> and <em>commands</em> to allow for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These SQL statements were placed within methods which took in parameters related to the sdvid DB. The CRUD oriented methods as well as the query methods could easily be changed for a variety of databases. It would also be relatively simple to expand the sdvid DB interaction capabilities of this dynamic web project. 
CSS styling of various elements of our pages. Flexbox, buttons, and tables were stylized in a theme that we hope will appease dark and light mode users alike. We relied on W3Schools excellent tutorials to find the .css commands we applied. 
Some non-code related challenges we overcame were communication and task management. On a single occasion we both had done the same task before pulling or pushing to github.  We also found a solid appreciation for team programming with github, it allowed us to juggle different schedules in different time-zones with ease. Slack was also an excellent resource for pair programming as well as communication over the weekend.
